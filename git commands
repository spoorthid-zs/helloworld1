13.When you get this while trying to push,
Updates were rejected,because the remote contains the work that you do not have locally.
It's because, you have made some changes in your branch remotelly and you don't have it locally 
so do
git stash
git pull origin your_branchName
then just give 
git push

you can see the commit under your issue.

git push origin -u <new_name>

Delete the <old_name> remote branch:
git push origin --delete <old_name>
